    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're craving Filipino comfort food, cook a pot of nilagang baboy. This boiled pork soup is easy to make as long as you give it plenty of time to simmer. </p>
    <p>For a soup full of texture, use pork spareribs and simmer it with corn, bok choy, and vegetables. If you prefer boneless pork, cut and sear cubes of pork shoulder or belly. Then cook the pork in broth along with fish sauce, green beans, and vegetables.</p>
